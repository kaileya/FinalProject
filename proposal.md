# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

breaKout!

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game that resembles the Atari game breakout.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will have a paddle, a ball that bounces off the paddle to rows of blocks above that dissappear after a certain number of hits. After certain blocks dissappear a power up will drop down. The power ups make the paddle bigger or the ball stronger. This will be executed using the basis of the Pong game, I will make a game that is similar to Breakout.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A paddle, ball that hits blocks, and blocks that dissappear after a certain time. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A paddle, ball that hits blocks, blocks that dissappear after a certain time, drop power ups that make the paddle bigger. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A paddle, ball that hits blocks, blocks that dissappear after a certain time and blink when hit, drop power ups that make the paddle bigger or the ball stronger. 


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will work through the Pong game module. I will need to learn how to work in LUA, fully understand the game, and learn how to make everything.
